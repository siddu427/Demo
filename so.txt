I can issue the clear command or press Ctrl + L 
to clear the current Ubuntu terminal, but this just
 shifts previous output upwards and if you use mouse
 scroll or PgUP and PgDown keys it's hard to distinguish
 where the output of previous command ends and output of current 
command begins.

Is there a way to really clear the terminal so I won't see previous command results?
